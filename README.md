# Portfolio
The portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a clean UI and mobile-friendly design. It helps me present my projects, GitHub work, and technical abilities in an organized way. This website is also used as an online resume and a platform to highlight my learning journey and development experience.
